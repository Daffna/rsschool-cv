## *About me*

* I am 29 years old. By education I am a teacher. But since 2015 I have been working as flight attendant. During this time I was able to visit many countries and cities. And I think it's time to change my life once again. The IT industry has always been attractive to me. So since the beginning of 2023 I have been studying IT. This is a difficult but very interesting path. The path of constant self-development and learning. And I love it! *

## *Skills*

* Git, GitHub
* HTML and CSS (beginner)
* C 

## *Code example*

Bubble sort :
```
void sort(int *arr) {
    int temp;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10 - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 10 - i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
